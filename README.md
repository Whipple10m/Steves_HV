# Steves_HV
Perl scripts to control the HV system

This is a text-based system to control the Whipple HV system (from circa 2000) that was useful for doing certain manipulations (bulk modifying the voltages to equalize the gains for example). It is not the official Whipple HV GUI, written by Rod Lessard at Purdue (which I don't seem to have any more).
